    The best way to help Flux grow is to tell your friends about us.
    Organic growth is really taking off, and with an upcoming double dissolution it’s more important than ever before to make sure your communities know about Flux.
    So please share our posts like our explainer video on your social media accounts. Or you can create your own posts, just make sure you tag us with #voteflux and #auspol so we can follow along!
- title: Community Forum
  copy: 'Our <a href="https://forum.flux.party/" target="_blank">community forum</a>
    is where we will be organising our campaign. If you''re interested sharing your
    ideas, coordinating campaigns or if have any super powers come and let us know!
